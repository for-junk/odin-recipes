  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This amazing Hawaiian comfort food classic is made by topping rice with a fried burger, which is then smothered with a rich, brown gravy and finished with a fried egg. Seriously, how did it take until 1949 for someone to think of this combination? We all get hangry sometimes, so whether you're a broke student or an older professional who just wishes you were, this cheap, filling bowl of goodness is the perfect solution. Garnish with green onions.</p>
